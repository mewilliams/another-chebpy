**another-ChebPy** is a **Python** code dedicated to solution of differential equations using Spectral Methods.


**another-ChebPy** includes Python version of codes featuring in N. Trefethen's well known book "Spectral Methods in Matlab".

First I will re-write all the programs found in Trefethen's book. My plan is to go beyond that afterwards  and continue adding more examples.
Last code in Trefethen's book is named p40, so examples named p41 and beyond will be new examples.

I am grateful to Boyd, CHQZ team (Canuto, Hussaini, Quarteroni, Zang), Peyret, Kopriva, Funaro, Trefethen, of course Orszag and Gottlieb and others for developing and promoting this beautiful numerical method.

Implementation relies on **Numpy**, **Scipy** and **Matplotlib**.

Any contribution is welcome.

P.S. After finding out that the code named chebPy already exists, I have decided to name this code another-chebPy to help people make distinction between these two similar software efforts.
